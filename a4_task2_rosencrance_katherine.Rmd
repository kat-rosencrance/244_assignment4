# Overview {.tabset}

This report will explore fish passage data from 2001-01-01 to 2010-12-31 at the Willamette Falls fish ladder in Oregon. Data were shared and accessed from Columbia River DART. The Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife (ODFW) mans a station at the falls where fish counts are recorded every day, 24 hours a day. This report will specifically look at time series, seasonal plots, and total counts for steelhead, coho, and coho jack salmon.

## Setup 

```{r setup, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE)

### attach packages
library(here)
library(tidyverse)
library(janitor)
library(tsibble)
library(feasts)
library(fable)

### read in data
fish <- read_csv(here("data", "willamette_fish_passage.csv")) %>%
  replace(is.na(.), 0) %>%
  clean_names() %>% 
  select("date", "coho", "jack_coho", "steelhead")


### have R read date as date, make it a tibble
fish_ts <- fish %>% 
  mutate(date = lubridate::mdy(date)) %>% 
  as_tsibble(key = NULL, index = date)


```

## Original time series

```{r}
### want to make a plot with date on x axis and count of fish on y, so cleaning up the rows to do that
fish_longer<- fish_ts %>%
  pivot_longer(cols = 2:4, names_to = "species", values_to = "count") %>% 
    mutate(species = case_when(
    species == "coho" ~ "Coho",
    species == "jack_coho" ~ "Jack Coho", 
    species == "steelhead" ~ "Steelhead"))

### make the plot
ggplot(data = fish_longer, aes(x = date, y = count, color = species))+
  geom_line(size = 0.75, alpha = 0.9)+
  theme_minimal()+
  labs(x = "Date",
       y = "Number of fish",
       title = "Number of Coho, Coho Jack, and Steelhead Salmon",
       subtitle = "2001-01-01 to 2010-12-31")+
  scale_color_manual(values = c("darkgreen", "salmon", "darkgray"))
```
